## TrevaLabs
 
[TrevaLabs](https://www.TrevaLabs.com) is a collective of climate data visualisation creatives in Europe, brought together by the desire to make a big impact with little pictures. Its mission is to rapidly create little pictures of climate for maximal human impact, and the vision is to reach every European by the end of decade with a little picture on Climate.

## Background on this CLIP
Sea level rise is one of the best known and already most visible signs of climate change in many regions of the world. For this reason, the "classic curve" of the rise is presented in this CLIP. In contrast to other representations, however, a classification is to be made here along comments. These can be explanations of the curve itself (as currently shown), dates of climate conferences or other temporal classifications.

## Data Sources

The CLIP uses the following datasets:
- [ESA Open Data website](https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/project/sea-level)
